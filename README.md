# Forrest Fire Detection
This repository contains code for a simple image classification task that classifies forest images into two categories: "Forest Fire" and "Non Forest Fire". A Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is used for this classification task. The code is implemented using TensorFlow and can be run on Google Colab.

**Dataset**
The dataset used for this project is available in the "Dataset.zip" file. It contains two main subdirectories: "Training" and "Testing". The "Training" subdirectory contains subfolders "fire" and "no_fire", each containing respective images. The "Testing" subdirectory directly contains test images.

**Setup**
Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.

Extract the contents of "Dataset.zip" into the repository directory. << i am not providing this in this repository

**If you're running the code on Google Colab:**__

Upload the entire repository (including the extracted dataset) to your Google Drive.

**Usage**
The forest_fire_classification.ipynb notebook provides step-by-step instructions on data preprocessing, model building, training, and evaluation. You can run this notebook on Google Colab.
